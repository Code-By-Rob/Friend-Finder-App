## Description + motive
Friend Finder App is an Android native application written in Java. For the Professional Development module in our preultimate year of university at Manchester Metropolitan University.

### University's Project Description
Social isolation is a concern for many, and this has been greatly exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic. Meeting others with similar interests is surprisingly tricky in the modern era, especially if you are not already an active member of clubs or societies related to your interests.
One way in which technology has attempted to alleviate the concerns of social isolation is the introduction of friend finding apps. These apps range from apps which allow for brief periods of contact in times of panic or peril with a semi-stranger, to apps which identified local meetups and hobbyist groups based on an individual’s interests.
Through this project, you will be required to investigate the moral and ethical considerations of a friend finding app, plus consider the legal responsibilities of an app which can put people in contact with each other. You may also choose to investigate additional features such as a match-making algorithm or advertisement services (e.g. for hobbyist groups).

### University's Expected Deliverables
A piece of software – most likely either a website, or a mobile – which offers individuals the opportunity to identify potential sources of social contact with others.

## Project Completion
